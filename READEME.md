## Weather-Forecasting

Weather-Forecast app is what the title says it is. It's a quick, simple weather app. The features include the basics, including forecasts, current temperature, rain possibility and precipitation information.  Other than that, it's really not all that complicated. It's free to download with no in-app purchases and the source code available.

The weather app supports global locations and has customizable Live Tile support. It is a nice option for the times you just need to check in on the weather to plan for your week ahead, your weekend plans or any other times when the weather could play a factor.

The Weather-Forecast uses the DarkSky API to get the current weather. It is the easiest, most advanced, weather API on the web. DarkSky API is free to use for smaller-scale applications. Large applications with bigger user bases may need to opt into one of the paid plans in order to satisfy the higher callâ€“per-minute needs.
